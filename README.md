## Overview
YFCC, CC and DATACOMP are three largest image datasets used in computer vision research. 
In this experiment, you will be tasked to answer the following question for a set of images:  **does this image come from YFCC, CC or DATACOMP**?

You will see many images from each of the datasets to **learn their unique characteristics, for example, what content they tend to cover**, to help you solve this task.

**These test images are not in the samples on the left, so please do not try to find them by refreshing the samples. These are new images from these datasets.**

**While you do the test, please feel free to continue studying the samples on the left, for as long as you would like to, and as many samples as you would like to.**

After you finish all 10 questions on one page, you can click **Submit This Page** on the bottom to submit your answers, and see the correct answers for this page. Then, you can click **Next** to proceed with the questions on the next page. You can also move back to previous submitted pages by clicking the **Prev** button, but you can not change your answers once you submit.
